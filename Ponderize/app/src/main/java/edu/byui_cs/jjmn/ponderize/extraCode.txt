The following code is to be placed in MainActivity.java after the declaration of omniList, proList, and memList.
It reads the info in the preloadedScriptures file in assets into a string, and then writes that string to a
file in internal storage that is then called by the onStart to load all of the preloaded scriptures into omniList.

    /*
    * Load the pre-loaded scriptures from the res file.
    */

    StringBuilder returnString = new StringBuilder();
    InputStream fIn = null;
    InputStreamReader isr = null;
    BufferedReader input = null;
    String line = "";
    try {
      fIn = getResources().getAssets()
              .open("preloadedScriptures", MODE_WORLD_READABLE);
      isr = new InputStreamReader(fIn);
      input = new BufferedReader(isr);

      while ((line = input.readLine()) != null) {
        returnString.append(line);
      }
    } catch (Exception e) {
      e.getMessage();
    }

    // The file path of the file in the internal directory with the pre-loaded scriptures
      File saveFile = new File(getFilesDir(), "scriptureFile.json");

      //Save list to saveFile.
      FileWriter writer;
      try {
        writer = new FileWriter (saveFile);
        writer.write (fileString);
        writer.close ();
      } catch (Exception e ) {
        e.printStackTrace ();
      }
